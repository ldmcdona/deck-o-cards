# deck-o-cards
A deck of cards game that allows 2 players to connect to a server and play together via terminal. Uses sockets and pre-set ports so maybe give the code a look before playing.

Initial testing suggests all bugs are cleared out and the code is commented. I might rework a few things but this project is looking pretty close to done.

Feel free to make a branch and modify for your own ends. 

Testing was done via 'localhost'. Please be careful with inputs as I have yet to properly setup catches for all potential errors.
